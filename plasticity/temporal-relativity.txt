Let the apparent time be denoted by sₐ.
Say there is an outside observer with an inertial frame of reference whose time unit shall be denoted by s₀.
Their temporal speed would be 1 sₐ/s₀.
Let's not discuss how this can be observed, nor the logistics behind it.
Say our world runs at the same temporal speed as the observer, then our world would run in 1 sₐ/s₀.
Say our world runs at twice the temporal speed as the observer, then our world would run in 2 sₐ/s₀; however to us the temporal speed would still remain at 1 sₐ/sₐ.
We can convince ourselves that the actual temporal speed of our world relative to the observer should not affect the perception of time within our world.
Consequentially, our world could run at 0 sₐ/s₀, where we would never know the difference.
If time did not exist when the universe started, then there shall be nothing that accerlated us in the temporal axis and therefore our temporal speed shall be kept at 0.
Therefore, to the observer, our world could be on halt, or rather never started. Except our world would still function normally as it should, with a time step size of 0.
