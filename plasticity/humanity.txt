The human soul is such a beautifully complex and fundamentally ingenious thing. Yet, it is so fragile.

Humanity have grown and evolved, from being a pile of worthless dust, to what is now known to be the most superior form of intelligence. Onwards we must proceed, to the far greater world that is the universe, which we will set up new homes throughout.

But before that, we must first step through the juvenility of humanity as it now is. To human is to fault, for we cannot foresee the unforeseeable. But every wrongdoing you have committed, every sin you have ever realised, will eventually be forgotten.

The existence of any of us is merely too small to have any significance regarding the grand scheme of things. All is but grains of sand in this endless seashore. Even if you try your best to do what you must, no one can ever escape from the prison that is our own body, for none of us are immortal. What we experience now must end and will end.

Then we shall do nothing and wait until our untimely demise. But no. If you and your existence and your actions may not be of any significance, then so be it. What must be done shall be done.

Surely time will wash away your work, diluting the world's memory of you, until no one in the world know that you have ever existed, but make it not the excuse to sit. Do what you must, and don't what you mustn't.

Peace and quietness will come to hug, but not before you have learnt to embrace the darkness within our collective existence known as humanity.
