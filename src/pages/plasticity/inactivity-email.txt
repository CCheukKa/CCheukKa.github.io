Dear Sir/Madam,

I appreciate your efforts in contacting me via this email address. However, I must inform you that this email address and its correlated Google account is inactive due to numerous potential reasons.

If it is due to retirement, it should indicate that my days on the internet is officially over and that I have thus retired from it, enjoying my last days here on earth. Should it be an urgent matter, please contact me via my phone number or postal services.

If it is due to me being in a coma, I apologise for being out of service in the foreseeable future. In the event that I do recover, I shall ensure that I would tend to this matter to the best of my abilities as soon as possible. However, in the event that I do not recover, please refer to the next paragraph.

If it is due to death, please make yourself known that I am sincerely honoured to have you find me worthy of your time. But sadly to say, I am afraid my time here on earth is up. Your condolences are greatly appreciated should you intend to express any.

Among the above scenarios, I shall rank the last to be the most likely as I have intended to bind this email address to myself for my entire life. But fret not, for there shall always be scenarios less grim and morbid. Until there be a concrete answer, let me apologise with my utmost sincerity once again for being out of service.
I shall wish you have a beautiful rest of your day.

Sincerely, 
Chan Cheuk Ka (CCheukKa)
(born in 2003 A.D.)
