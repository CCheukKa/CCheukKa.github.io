You know, if we as a species can progress, if we can, it is within our reach.
To progress, from one letter, to two.
By then, and only by then, can we expand our vocabulary.
Oh my 
Imagine the technological advancements
This one, this very one, will be the one, that mankind, have never ever seen, in human history
For us, for mankind, for the world! For the very existence of ours, we shall, march onwards, towards a higher plane of existence
Yes, with you, with me, with us! Push the limits of what our mortal coils shall allow for, then we shall progress, into this new and never foreseen era, of dual-letter communication.
Humanity is in our very hands. To do or not to do, it is a question. A question with the answer that our very existence shall allow us to execute. For it is now, or never; never, or now. For never is ever, and ever is now. Now it must be done, and done it must be.
We shall. Progress.
